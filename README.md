# Cookiecutter Minimal

A minimal project structure for use with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter)

This is more tailored to me and how I structure my code. So, if you're interested in this, you may want to fork it with your own changes.

## Features

- Python 3.8+
- Multiple licenses: [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/) and [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/)
- [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/): Strict configurations
- Command-line interface using [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)

## Quick Usage

Install [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) if you haven't:

```
~ pip install -U cookiecutter
```

Generate a new project:
